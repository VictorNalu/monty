0. push, pall
mandatory
Score: 0.0% (Checks completed: 0.0%)
Implement the push and pall opcodes.

The push opcode

The opcode push pushes an element to the stack.

Usage: push <int>
where <int> is an integer
if <int> is not an integer or if there is no argument given to push, print the error message L<line_number>: usage: push integer, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
where is the line number in the file
You won’t have to deal with overflows. Use the atoi function

1. pint
mandatory
Score: 0.0% (Checks completed: 0.0%)
Implement the pint opcode.

The pint opcode

The opcode pint prints the value at the top of the stack, followed by a new line.

Usage: pint
If the stack is empty, print the error message L<line_number>: can't pint, stack empty, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE

2. pop
mandatory
Score: 0.0% (Checks completed: 0.0%)
Implement the pop opcode.

The pop opcode

The opcode pop removes the top element of the stack.

Usage: pop
If the stack is empty, print the error message L<line_number>: can't pop an empty stack, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE

3. swap
mandatory
Score: 0.0% (Checks completed: 0.0%)
Implement the swap opcode.

The swap opcode

The opcode swap swaps the top two elements of the stack.

Usage: swap
If the stack contains less than two elements, print the error message L<line_number>: can't swap, stack too short, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE

4. add
mandatory
Score: 0.0% (Checks completed: 0.0%)
Implement the add opcode.

The add opcode

The opcode add adds the top two elements of the stack.

Usage: add
If the stack contains less than two elements, print the error message L<line_number>: can't add, stack too short, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
The result is stored in the second top element of the stack, and the top element is removed, so that at the end:
The top element of the stack contains the result
The stack is one element shorter

5. nop
mandatory
Score: 0.0% (Checks completed: 0.0%)
Implement the nop opcode.

The nop opcode

The opcode nop doesn’t do anything.

Usage: nop
